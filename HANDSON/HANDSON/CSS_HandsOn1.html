<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
<ol class="list1">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
    <li><span class="first">Css is not necessary.</span> <span class="second">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
    <li><span class="third">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
<ul class="list2">
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>Exrernal - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.
    However, <span class="fourth">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand,
    applies a style to one unique element, ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    <br><br>
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    <br><br>
    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be appied.
